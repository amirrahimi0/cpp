This C++ code implements a generic Bubble Sort algorithm using templates. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is fully sorted.
